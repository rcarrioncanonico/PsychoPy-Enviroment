    "# Getting Your Computer Ready for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will guide you through setting up your computer for data science and cognitive task development. We primarily use this resource as the foundation:\n",
    "- https://neuraldatascience.io/b-setup/introduction/\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended Setup Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Install VS Code\n",
    "- Install VS Code on your computer directly rather than using GitHub Codespace\n",
    "- This makes it easier to open and manage files on your local system\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Install Anaconda\n",
    "- Install the full **Anaconda** distribution (not mini-anaconda)\n",
    "- Mini-conda can lead to missing packages that must be manually installed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Windows PowerShell Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter permission errors when running commands, you may need to enable script execution on Windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open PowerShell as Administrator (right-click and select \"Run as administrator\")\n",
    "2. Run the following command:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. This allows you to run downloaded commands and scripts like `mamba env create -f neural_data_science.yml`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This is due to Windows execution policy restrictions. If you encounter issues installing the neural_data_science environment, this is likely the solution."
