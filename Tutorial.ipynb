    "# Getting Your Computer Ready for Data Science:\n",
    "- We will primary use this resource as the base to getting your computer ready for data science and coding\n",
    "- https://neuraldatascience.io/b-setup/introduction/\n",
    "    - Recomendations:\n",
    "        - Install VS-code in your computer instead of running it on Github Codespace, it will be easier to open important files directly to your computer\n",
    "        - Installing Anaconda instead of mini-anaconda, as I´ve install mini-anaconda myself I ran into some errors like missing packages which will need to be manually installed.\n",
    "            - If some of the functions do not run as intented you will have to open powercell and enable this functions to run as sometimes windows does not led you run donwloaded comands on your computer\n",
    "                    - maybe check on this later to give a clear solution to this problem (youtube history)\n",
    "                    - Its with having problems installing the neural_data_science enviroment, sometimes when running the code \"mamba env create -f neural_data_science.yml\" its not permitted, you will have to allow this by\n",
    "                    - This is because of the execution policy of windows, in order to change it, open powercell in administration mode (right click on powercell and click on open as administrator)}\n",
    "                        - After that run this code. Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser\n",
    "                        - You will now be able to run the mamba env create -f neural_data_science.yml line of code.\n"
